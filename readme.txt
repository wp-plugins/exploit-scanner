Search the files and database of your WordPress install for malicious code or spammy links left by a hacker.

== Description ==
This plugin searches the files on your website, and the posts and comments tables of your database for anything suspicious. It also examines your list of active plugins for unusual filenames.

It does not remove anything. That is left to the user to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I fix the out of memory error? =

Scanning your website can take quite a bit of memory. The plugin tries to allocate 128MB but sometimes that's not enough. You can modify the amount of memory PHP has access to from within the plugin admin page. You can also limit the max size of scanned files. Reduce this number to skip more files but be aware that it may miss hacked files. Any skipped files are listed after scanning. Memory is also used if you have deep directories because of the way the scanner works. It will help if you clean out any cache directories (wp-content/cache/ for example) before scanning.

== Updates ==
Updates to the plugin will be posted here, to [Holy Shmoly!](http://ocaoimh.ie/) and the [WordPress Exploit Scanner](http://ocaoimh.ie/exploit-scanner/) page will always link to the newest version.

If you use The Japanese version of WordPress, you can use [these hash files](http://wpbiz.jp/files/exploit-scanner-hashes/ja/) instead. Thanks Naoko for telling me about that!
